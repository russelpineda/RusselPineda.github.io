		<p class ="paralign"> This was my first CIS class ever since I left college in 2015. I was simultaneously nervous and excited about it. 
		I was nervous because I have never had any experience with web development. When I was in college, I was going for Computer 
		Information System Networking and Administrative Associate Degree. This major was about cisco, and I don’t remember anything 
		that talks about web development. So, I am totally amateur when it comes to working as a web developer. Additionally, I was
		skeptical about taking the online class since I thought it would be harder to learn when it can’t be taught in person.
		It is also easier to procrastinate and requires good time management skills. On the other hand, I was thrilled when I read 
		the description about this class. I always wanted to learn how to create my own website and maybe I can make a career out of it. 
		So, I was looking forward to starting my CIS 241 class this quarter and enhancing my knowledge about Computer Information Systems
		field.
		</p>
		<p class ="paralign"> The skepticism and pessimistic feelings I had before taking this class were all gone because everything was easy, organized,
		and well taught during the online class. Our Professor Frank made it easier to follow all steps on labs and assignments. 
		This was a good set-up for those students who didn’t have much experience on this subject. Even myself, I understood the 
		assignment because it was literally explained step by step; you can’t make a mistake at all. Also, even if you are confused
		about anything, our instructor is going to be there for you to guide you in the right direction. So, I would say our professor 
		has a high level of communication and assistance to his students.
		</p>
		<p class ="paralign">In conclusion, I have learned a lot of skills I can use as a web developer since I took this class. I enjoyed learning 
		about basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was fun and challenging at the same time when I was creating my first website. 
		It is shocking how much syntax can affect a web page. It is also nice to see that I can make a lot of animations using CSS 
		and JavaScript in my HTML. This will let my website look a lot presentable and alive to my viewers. I am thankful that I 
		took this class because I have improved my skills and attained knowledge about web development. I am very excited to move 
		on to my next quarter class to learn more in CIS field.
