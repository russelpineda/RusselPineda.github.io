		<p class ="paralign"> Welcome to my first website and you can call me Sell. I live in Everett Washington with my beautiful wife and two active toddlers. 
		I got married with my wife 4 years ago, and now I have a 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter. I met my wife in San Diego California, 
		and I love the city. I like the food and weather out there. I moved my family back here due to my work related and my family situation. 
		However, I would come back to California again when I see a good opportunity.
		</p>
		<p class ="paralign">  Here is a little about me and my interests. I am an active-duty military, and currently in college to learn Web Design. 
		My originally plan was to complete my Computer Information System- Network Technology and Administration Associate Degree since it will let me transfer to another college to get my bachelor’s degree.
		However, I started to think about having a business on my own in the future. So, I want to get a Business Degree as well. 
		So, my goal is to complete my Associate of Technical Arts Degree for Computer Information Systems and start my Business Management Degree afterward. 
		On computer field, I have amateur background. Nevertheless, I am up for the challenge; I am willing to embrace the hardship and better myself. 
		</p>
		<p class ="paralign">  Working out is my passion, and if I don’t workout, I would probably be chubby since I eat a lot. I also don’t eat healthy at all; I eat junk food and a lot of it.
		I have tried to eat healthy, but I just can’t. Additionally, I workout to have a good skin, good routine, and become active in life.
		Since I have been working out, it helps me to clear out my pimples and make my face fresh. 
		Also, when it is in my head that I have to workout, I can easily get up in the morning which helps me to start my day better.
		Finally, when working requires strength, I can easily complete the job since I am fit. Overall, working out makes me happy, and it is part of my life now.
