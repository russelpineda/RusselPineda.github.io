				      <p class ="paralign">American football is one of my favorite sports to watch. 
					  Let me tell you a story of mine when I first got here in United States. At first, 
					  I didn’t know what American football was, until one day all my family gathered up 
					  in our place to watch it. It was Sunday night when Seattle Seahawks team played 
					  against San Francisco 49ers. My family was all hyped up during the game. They were 
					  cheering and shouting at the TV. I felt the excitement and started liking it more whenever 
					  a team makes a touchdown. I never realized how football has helped me relieve some stress
					  and how Sundays became our family gathering day.

				     <p class ="paralign"> Another sport I like doing is basketball. Playing basketball is another way to stay fit and healthy. 
						It can also help you to make new friends who are young or old. Sometimes, it is not only enjoyable,
						but it also teaches you to improve yourself and how to be a good team player. In fact, basketball 
						is known as a good pastime in many people’s eyes, but it can also be seen as a passion for many 
						others. I love to watch and play the game because it is a very entertaining sport, and it can help
						me to release stress. This is also another way to stay connected to our society since this sport 
						is popular and can be played by anyone.

					  <h3>Anime</h3>
								  	<!-- My Picture-->
		<div class="col-md-12 col-md-3 col-lg-offset-1">
		
			<img src="images/anime.jpg" alt="Anime" width="280" height="260" style="border: 12px solid #87ceeb; border-radius: 15px" />
		</div>
	</nav>
				      <p class ="paralign"> There are many reasons why Anime has taken my interest. If I would have 
					  to explain it, it would be the life lessons behind all the movies and series of each Anime I have 
					  watched. Anime is filled with attractive lessons and life stories. People mistake it as childish, 
					  and unrealistic just because it has animation, but in many ways, it surpasses many live action series
					  in terms of unrealistic. It is deep and very emotional when it comes to connection. It provides 
					  powerful themes, cohesive plots, and a vast variety of different topics to capitalize on. So, 
					  whenever I have free time, I spend most of my time watching Anime. It has become part of me now.

					<h3>Crypto</h3>

				      <p class ="paralign"> At some point in my life, I want to retire as early as I can. 
					  I don’t want to work all my life. I want to be able to enjoy life with my family before 
					  I leave the world. I want to explore and experience the traditions each country has to offer. 
					  I also want to enjoy food without worrying about money. As In result, I became interested 
					  in investing my money in Cryptocurrency. I am amateur when it comes to it, but I am slowly 
					  getting into it. Eventually, my investment will pay off over the long-term. Hopefully,
					  this will help me to retire early as I planned.
